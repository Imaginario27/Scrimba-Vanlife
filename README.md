# VANLIFE

Vanlife is a sample React web application that demonstrates the use of React Router and protected routes. This project serves as a starting point for building web applications with authentication and routing capabilities. In this app, we have implemented a basic structure with several key pages and features:

- Home Page
- Host Page (Protected Route) + Some protected subpages
- About Page
- Van List Page
- Van Detail Page

Additionally, Vanlife includes a fake login mechanism to test the protected host route.

## Features
### 1. Home Page
The Home Page provides an introduction to the Vanlife app and its purpose.

### 2. Host Page (Protected Route)
- The Host Page is a protected route that requires authentication. Users must log in to access this page. You can use the fake login mechanism provided in the app to test this feature.
- Inside the host page there are some subpages such as dashboard, incomes, hosts vans and reviews.

### 3. About Page
The About Page offers information about the app's creators and its mission.

### 4. Van List Page
The Van List Page displays a list of available vans. Users can click on a van to view more details.

### 5. Van Detail Page
The Van Detail Page provides in-depth information about a selected van.
